# automatic-invention

## Purpose
In recognizing the utility of becoming more familiar with Bash Scripting, I created this repo to document my journey through learning bash as I develop scripts to perform various automation tasks. Feel free to send me any links, resources, or scripts you have created that might aid in my learning journey! 

#### Note:
This folder might also contain some batch, powershell, and python scripting for Windows related automation
_(Wish my work would use linux more :sad: )_
